# Hand Gesture Recognition with Python using Google MediaPipe Library

  The Hand Gesture Recognition project utilizes Python programming language and the Google MediaPipe library to accurately count the number of raised fingers in a human hand. This project leverages the power of computer vision techniques to detect and analyze hand gestures in real-time, making it applicable in various fields such as human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and gesture-based control systems.

  This project serves as an educational tool for learning about computer vision, image processing, and gesture recognition techniques using Python. It can be further extended to recognize and classify various hand gestures for different applications.
